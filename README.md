I Ensured that event handlers in React components are properly assigned to the correct events.

When rendering dynamic lists or tables in React, making sure to include a unique key prop for each item to optimize rendering performance and to avoid potential issues 
with React reconciliation.

While updating state based on the previous state, use the functional form of the state update function to ensure accuracy, 
especially in scenarios with asynchronous state updates or multiple state changes within the same event loop.

Considered using controlled components for form inputs in React, where the input value is controlled by state. 
This allows for easier manipulation and validation of user input.

Use inline styles or CSS classes to dynamically style components based on their state or props, such as applying a strikethrough 
text decoration for completed tasks in a todo list.
